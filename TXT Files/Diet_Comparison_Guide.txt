doctor’s orders: 5 guidelines for lasting results
life-long approaches: look for life-long approaches to healthy eating and avoid “dieting,” which is only a temporary solution.
avoid restrictive diets: avoid diets that are too restrictive and eliminate important vitamins, minerals, and nutrients.
nutritionally-balanced diet: strive to achieve a nutritionally-balanced diet with healthy foods from each food group.
healthy weight: achieve a healthy weight with a calorically-balanced diet and routine exercise.
plant-based diets: plant-based diets are best for health and longevity. make fruits, vegetables, and whole grains your diet mainstay.
side-by-side comparisons
vegan diet

theory/concept: eliminates all animal products including meat, fish, poultry, dairy, and eggs.
caffeine?: in moderation
alcohol?: avoid alcoholic drinks that are clarified using animal-derived substances.
length of diet?: life-long
cost?: average
health pros:
may decrease heart disease
generally lower in saturated fat
high in fiber if eating lots of fruits and vegetables
health cons:
need to be diligent in meeting nutritional requirements, particularly iron, b-12, zinc, vitamin d, and omega-3s.
doctor’s final say: studies have shown that a plant-based diet is the best for health and longevity. requires diligence in keeping up with enough fruits, veggies, and supplements.
paleo diet

theory/concept: replaces dairy and grain products with free-range meat, fresh fruits, and vegetables. usually 65% animal-based and 35% plant-based.
caffeine?: in moderation
alcohol?: in moderation (avoid grain-based alcohol)
length of diet?: life-long
cost?: high
health pros:
more fruits and vegetables
cuts out added sugar and sodium
combination of plant-based foods and protein can help control blood sugar, maintain weight loss
health cons:
exclusion of whole grains, legumes, and dairy can be risky. these foods are nutrient-rich and contain important vitamins and minerals such as calcium and vitamin d.
doctor’s final say: paleo eliminates a significant amount of healthy vitamins and minerals. could be helpful for a patient trying to "detox" from a high carbohydrate or sugar diet. okay, perhaps for more than 12 weeks.
vegetarian diet

theory/concept: no animal meat but includes dairy, eggs, and other products from animals.
caffeine?: in moderation
alcohol?: in moderation
length of diet?: life-long
cost?: average
health pros:
may decrease heart disease
generally lower in saturated fat
emphasizes fruits, vegetables, and non-meat protein sources
high in fiber if eating lots of fruits and vegetables
health cons:
need to be diligent in meeting nutritional requirements, particularly iron, b-12, zinc, vitamin d, and omega-3s.
doctor’s final say: this is a healthy diet strategy, as plant-based diets are the healthiest.
atkins diet

theory/concept: cuts carbohydrates.
caffeine?: none initially. in moderation after 2 weeks.
alcohol?: none initially. in moderation after 2 weeks.
length of diet?: phase one (the most restrictive) lasts two weeks. the rest of the diet lasts as long as it takes to lose weight.
cost?: high
health pros:
less refined sugar, white rice/flour = fewer calories from refined foods
fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain foods are encouraged after the two-week induction period
may improve lipid profile
modified versions promote a healthier variety of foods like lean protein, produce, nuts, legumes, and, in some cases, whole grains and healthy fats.
health cons:
may be too restricted in carbohydrates
too much protein can harm people prone to kidney issues
doctor’s final say: a high protein diet that has been effective for weight loss. modified atkins diet is more practical and can be done long-term. otherwise, a strict atkins diet is hard to maintain.
zone diet

theory/concept: a small amount of protein (approximately the size of your palm) with “favorable” carbs twice the size of the protein portion.
caffeine?: no
alcohol?: in moderation
length of diet?: life-long
cost?: average if cooking yourself. can be expensive with meal-delivery services.
health pros:
portion-controlled serving of protein with lots of fruits and vegetables can lead to nutrients
emphasizes heart-healthy monounsaturated fats
health cons:
may be too restricted in carbohydrates
too much protein can harm people prone to kidney issues
doctor’s final say: healthy diet, high protein intake. can be used as a long-term diet.
