how to create a workout plan
creating an effective workout plan can be a mix of science and art, especially when balancing strength training, cardio, flexibility, and rest. here’s a guide to help you craft a balanced and efficient workout routine:

key points to remember:

individual responses: different bodies respond differently to various training types. trial and error will help find the best balance for you.
professional guidance: if you're just starting or recovering from an injury, consider meeting with a personal trainer to assess form and provide modifications.
doctor’s approval: always check with a doctor before making any fitness or nutrition changes.
common mistakes:

overtraining: training too hard consistently (like doing barry's bootcamp or orangetheory every day) can lead to diminishing returns and increased risk of injuries.
lack of rest: training the same muscle groups daily without allowing rest can impede progress. rest is crucial for results.
monotonous cardio: not alternating cardio intensities (hiit, steady state, tempo work, liss, hill training) can limit effectiveness.
inefficient gym time: maximize gym time with supersets or circuit training, especially if you’re busy.
neglecting strength training: while cardio can help shrink your body, strength training shapes it and protects bone density as we age.
weekly workout plan
4 days of strength training:

upper and lower split:

day 1: upper body
day 2: lower body
day 3: upper body
day 4: lower body
example split:
day 1: shoulders, chest, and triceps
day 2: legs
day 3: back and biceps
day 4: legs (emphasis on different leg exercises)
rest days: pick 1-2 days off from formal exercise. use these days for light activities like walking, yoga, or stretching.

label your strength days: write down what you’ll do on each strength day. example:

sunday: off
monday: strength day 1 (upper body)
tuesday: cardio
wednesday: off
thursday: strength day 2 (lower body)
friday: cardio
saturday: strength day 3 (total body circuit)
cardio plan:

general rules: according to nasm guidelines, aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week.
types of cardio:
steady state: biking, jogging, power walking, dancing, stair climbing.
hiit: max 2-3 times a week on non-consecutive days.
tempo work or hill training: include these for variety and increased intensity.
how to structure strength training:

reps and sets:
stabilization/endurance: 12-20 reps with lower weights.
hypertrophy: 6-12 reps with moderate weights.
max strength: 1-6 reps with heavy weights.
power: 8-10 reps with mostly body weight.
splits and rest:
each muscle group needs 48 hours of rest between training sessions.
example splits:
2 days of strength: 1 upper, 1 lower.
3 days of strength: 1 upper, 1 lower, 1 total body.
4 days of strength: 2 upper, 2 lower or specific muscle group focus.
